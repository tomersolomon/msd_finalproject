*** Make sure to have run the .sh script in the ../data/wikispeedia_paths-and-graph directory ***

1.  intro_analysis.py: generates the exploratory analysis figures:

	a. histogram_click_freq.pdf
	b. path_freq.pdf
	c. opt3-opt4-opt5.pdf

This script may take 1 minute to run

2.  dist2.py: This graph generates: 
	a. optimal_path_ratios.pdf 

3.  category_analysis.R: R script, run as is in RStudio.  Generates the following figures in the plots directory
	a. categories_finished_paths.pdf
	b. categories_source_target.pdf
4.  regression_article_size_links.R, run as is in RStudio.  This generates the following figures in the plots directory: 
	a. regression_article_size_links.pdf

5.  lda_lsa.ipynb: This jupyter notebook generates the following files: 
	a.  ../data/task-data/data_with_semantics_all_columns_100d.csv
	b.  


6.  semantic_regression.ipynb:  This jupyter notebook creates the following figures under the plotss directory.  It reads in "../data/task-data/data_with_semantics_all_columns_100d.csv", which is generated by the lda_lsa.ipynb notebook. 
	a. semantic_regression_time.pdf
